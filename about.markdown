Just kidding. Please don't hack me.

I am someone who is infinitely curious. I obsess over how things work and am not satisfied until I achieve some level of understanding of whatever strikes my fancy. In an effort to focus and enhance my learning I decided to start this blog.

My main goal is to highlight the process of learning so that I may better understand things, and (if anyone reads this) help others see the mess of the journey. Too often I see perfectly curated articles that make it seem like everything works the first time. This has never been my experience especially since things constantly change and code is never left alone for long. 

I am not an expert in anything, but I know some things. Hopefully I will soon know more things. Maybe, if you read about what I am doing, you will know more things too.
